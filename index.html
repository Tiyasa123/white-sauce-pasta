To make white sauce pasta, you will follow three main steps: boiling the pasta, preparing a creamy béchamel sauce (or roux-based white sauce), and combining everything with any desired vegetables or protein. The entire process takes around 30 minutes.

<U><I>Ingredients</I></U>
<ul type = "square">
<li> 1 cup (100g) penne pasta (or other short pasta like macaroni, fusilli) </li>
<li> 4 cups water and salt for boiling pasta </li>
<li> 2 tbsp butter (plus a little extra for sautéing veggies) </li>
<li> 2 tbsp all-purpose flour (maida) </li>
<li> 1.5 cups milk (full-fat works best for creaminess; use cold milk to avoid lumps) </li>
<li> Optional: 1 cup mixed vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, sweet corn, carrots, mushrooms) </li>
<li> 2-3 cloves garlic, minced (optional, for flavor)</li>
<li> Optional: ¼ cup heavy cream or 2-3 tbsp grated cheese (Parmesan, cheddar, mozzarella) </li>
<li> ½ tsp dried oregano (or mixed Italian herbs) </li>
<li> ¼ tsp black pepper powder (adjust to taste) </li>
<li> Salt to taste </li>
<li> Optional: Red chili flakes for garnish </li>
</ul>

<ol type = "1">
<li> Cook the Pasta: 
<br>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until it is al dente (cooked through but still firm to the bite). Drain the pasta and set it aside, reserving about ¼ cup of the starchy pasta water for later use if needed. </li>
<li> Sauté Vegetables (Optional): 
<br>In a separate pan, heat a little butter or oil and sauté minced garlic for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add your choice of chopped vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes until tender yet crunchy. Season them with a pinch of salt and pepper, then remove the veggies from the pan and set aside. </li>
<li> Prepare the White Sauce (Béchamel): 
<br>In the same pan (or a clean one), melt 2 tablespoons of butter over low heat. Stir in the 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. Whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to cook the raw smell out of the flour without browning it (this mixture is called a roux).Turn off the heat. Gradually pour in the cold milk while whisking constantly to prevent the formation of lumps. Return the pan to medium-low heat. Continue to cook and whisk until the sauce thickens and evenly coats the back of a spoon (about 3-4 minutes). </li>
<li> Season the Sauce: 
<br>Turn the heat to low. Stir in the salt, black pepper, and oregano. If using, add the heavy cream and/or grated cheese and mix until the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is smooth. </li>
<li> Combine and Serve: 
<br>Add the cooked pasta and the sautéed vegetables into the white sauce pan. Toss everything gently until the pasta and vegetables are well coated. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a tablespoon or two of the reserved pasta water or milk to adjust the consistency. </li>
<li> Garnish and Enjoy: 
<br>Serve the white sauce pasta hot, garnished with red chili flakes or fresh herbs if desired. </li>
